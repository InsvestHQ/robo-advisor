# The VanAurum Open Robo-Advisor

This is an open source initiative to make available the tools required for building your own optimal Markowitz portfolios and finding the best rebalancing strategy factoring in your transaction costs. The financial world is moving towards zero cost ETFs, which make even the lowest-cost robo-advisors in the industry seem expensive.  

The mission of this project is to put industry leading portfolio management tools into the hands of individuals for zero cost.
